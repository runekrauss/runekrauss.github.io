This course is about computer architecture and digital circuits. The main aspects include, on the one hand, the different computer system levels / programming languages as well as how CPUs, caches, RAMs, hard drives etc. work together and, on the other hand, theoretical basics about Boolean algebra, logic synthesis, graph theory as well as how the previously introduced computer components can be constructed on this basis.
