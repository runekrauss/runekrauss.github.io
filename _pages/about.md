Hi!

I'm a Researcher with the Cyber-Physical Systems Department of the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/cyber-physical-systems) (DFKI) and a Doctoral Student in Computer Science and Mathematics at the [University of Bremen](https://uni-bremen.de/en/fb3).

My research and teaching interests include logic synthesis, testing of circuits/systems, and **formal verification** by model checking and equivalence checking to ensure the correctness of circuits, especially using decision diagrams. The main goals of my work are their algorithmic improvement and the development of novel graph-based data structures to increase the efficiency of computer-aided design for integrated circuits in terms of runtime and memory.

I'm also working on **evolutionary optimization** by artificial intelligences such as in the form of neuroevolution -- the synergy of artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms -- to efficiently solve large-scale machine learning problems like robot control tasks biologically inspired.

Furthermore, I've experience in information security, compiler construction, media design as well as economics.

Besides the voluntary work as a company first aider, in my free time I like to play chess and football, trade stocks, travel around the world, and try to improve my photographic skills.
