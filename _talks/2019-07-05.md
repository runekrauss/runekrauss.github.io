I presented our [BugRunner Turbo 2](https://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/projekttag/2019_ma/) project at *Projekttag Master Informatik*. The project dealt with the development of own analysis tools and artificial intelligences to find bugs in games so that e.g. speedruns can be exploited to play games more efficiently.
