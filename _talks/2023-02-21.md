Together with Marcel Merten, I presented our work *Scalable Neuroevolution of Ensemble Learners* as a *Group of Computer Architecture Talk* at University of Bremen. In the context of evolutionary optimization, it addresses one of its main issues: lack of scalability. To this end -- based on [ALF](/publication/2021-001) -- a framework was developed to heavily orchestrate genetic recombination for neural network combinations to effectively find suitable solutions. Moreover, ensemble learning methods restrict the search space. In a divide-and-conquer manner, the framework allows handling of large-scale machine learning problems.
