In this lecture in the undergraduate course *Technical Computer Science 1* at University of Bremen, I repeated and deepened the contents concerning computer architecture and digital circuits for the exam preparation. Besides many other topics, computer system levels, pipelining, memory hierarchy, parallelism, encoding of characters/numbers, and the Boolean calculus were included.
